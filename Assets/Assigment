Time frame : 1 week

1) Develop a Classic Sudoku game focusing on the game feel, its mechanics, and a satisfying core interaction & its
code scalability & reusability

2) Make a playable (60 fps) & solid (no crash) version of the game on Unity3D for Android or iOS

3) Your game must have these elements:
- 1 or 2 levels (maximum) looping
- Simple UI
- A huge focus on exeuction / toy / animation / juicyness / particles

Explain which parts of the code could be implemented as independent modules to allow faster development of
similar gamesbin the future, giving a brief explanation of your choices and how they would work.

Your project will be evaluated considering the following factors:
- General game feel.
-  Unity project structure.
-  Code readability and re-usability.

4) Please send us back (Drive document) :
- The source code (full Unity3D Project on Github) for review purpose
- An Android or iOS build for testing purpose
- Alin to a short gameplay video of your game

This test will allow us to evaluate not only your developers skills on Unity3D (clean & efficient code) but also your
creativity and UI sensitivity.

Now time to execute!
